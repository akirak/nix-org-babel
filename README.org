* nix-org-babel
This is a quick and dirty implementation of =org-babel-tangle= in Nix.
It provides a function that takes an Org string and returns the contents of source blocks in a particular language.

[[https://github.com/talyz/fromElisp][talyz/fromElisp]] has a built-in Org support, but I created this because I needed more control on which parts to extract. It provides an option for excluding subtrees matching a particular heading pattern. For example, you can omit archived subtrees from the output.
